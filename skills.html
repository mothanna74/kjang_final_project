    <p>To withstand its heavy workload, the engine must be a robust structure. It consists of two basic parts: the
        lower, heavier section is the cylinder block, a casing for the engine's main moving parts; the detachable upper
        cover is the cylinder head . The cylinder head contains valve-controlled passages through which the air and

        <p> fuel mixture enters the cylinders, and others through which the gases produced by their combustion are
        expelled. The block houses the crankshaft , which converts the reciprocating motion of the pistons into
        rotary motion at the crankshaft. Often the block also houses the camshaft </p>

        I figure there are other grown men out there who are like me — men who aren’t car guys but are a little curious
        about how their vehicles work. So I plan on sharing what I’m learning in my own study and tinkering in an
        occasional series we’ll call Gearhead 101. The goal is to explain the very basics of how various parts in a car
        work and provide resources on where you can learn more on your own.
